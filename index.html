      <h4 class="contain">This biography of Henry Ford provides detailed information about his life, achievements, works & timeline:</h4>  
        <ul class="main-contain">
            <li>Henry Ford was born on July 30, 1863, in Dearborn, Michigan, to William and Mary Ford. He had four siblings.</li>
            <li>He was bright and curious as a child. He was in his teens when his father gave him a pocket watch which he dismantled and reassembled by himself. He also practiced on the timepieces of friends and neighbors, and soon gained the reputation of a watch repairman. From a young age he demonstrated mechanical ability and leadership qualities.</li>
            <li>His mother died in 1876, leaving him devastated. He realized that he did not want to live on the farm anymore now that his mother was gone.</li>
            <li>He left home in 1879 to work as an apprentice machinist with James F. Flower & Bros. in Detroit. Later on he went to work for the Detroit Dry Dock Co. before returning home in 1882.</li>
            <li>His mechanical skills and ability to grasp new things led to his appointment as night engineer for the Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1891. He found the job very exciting as he got the opportunity to learn more about electricity which was a fairly new concept back then.</li>
            <li>He met with Thomas Edison who approved of his experimentation. Motivated, Ford continued on bettering his model of automobile, and completed a second vehicle in 1898.</li>
               <li>Ever the resilient soul, he started working on improving the quality of his automobiles and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. Then he teamed up the stockholders in his Detroit Automobile Company to form the Henry Ford Company in November 1901.</li>
            <li>In 1903, Henry incorporated the Ford Motor Company. The original investors included Henry Ford, Alexander Y. Malcomson, the Dodge brothers, and John S. Gray, among others. Around this time, the race driver Barney Oldfield drove the “999” around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States.</li>
            <li>The company launched the Model T in October 1908. The vehicle had a steering wheel on the left—an idea which other automobile companies soon copied. The model proved to be highly successful as it was not only affordable, but also very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair.</li>
            <li>Henry Ford was a pacifist and when the Second World War broke out in 1939, he opposed the United States’ entry into the war. However, when America entered the war, Ford Motor Company became one of the major US military contractors, supplying airplanes, engines, jeeps and tanks.</li>
            <li>A tragedy befell the aging Ford in 1943 when his son Edsel died of cancer. Even though Henry Ford formally resumed control of the company after his son’s death, he no longer exercised absolute authority. The key decisions were taken by others in his name and he was increasingly sidelined. Eventually his grandson, Henry Ford II, was made the president.</li>
            <li>Ford was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1928.</li>
            <li>In 1938, Ford was awarded Nazi Germany's Grand Cross of the German Eagle, a medal given to foreigners sympathetic to Nazism.</li>
            <li>He married Clara Jane Bryant in 1888 and had one son, Edsel, with her.</li>
            <li>Henry Ford died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 7 April 1947 at the age of 83.</li>
